# Creator wallet - becomes the creator of the auction house (cannot be changed)
# This is used in the PDA derivation for your auction house
# Can be the same as deployer wallet

# Authority wallet - can update auction house settings after deployment
# Recommendation: Use a multisig wallet for production
# Can be different from creator for better security

# Recommendation: Use a secure wallet separate from authority
# This is where your marketplace earnings will go
